TooLong is a log file viewer / navigator for the terminal.

Built with [Textual](https://www.textualize.io/)

Repository: [https://github.com/Textualize/toolong](https://github.com/Textualize/toolong) Author: [Will McGugan](https://www.willmcgugan.com)

---

### Navigation

- `tab` / `shift+tab` to navigate between widgets.
- `home` or `g` / `end` or `G` Jump to start or end of file. Press `end` a second time to *tail* the current file.
- `page up` / `page down` or `space` to go to the next / previous page.
- `←` or `h` / `→` or `l` Scroll left / right.
- `↑` or `w` or `k` / `↓` or `s` or `j` Move up / down a line.
- `m` / `M` Advance +1 / -1 minutes.
- `o` / `O` Advance +1 / -1 hours.
- `d` / `D` Advance +1 / -1 days.
- `enter` Toggle pointer mode.
- `escape` Dismiss.

### Other keys

- `ctrl+f` or `/` Show find dialog.
- `ctrl+l` Toggle line numbers.
- `ctrl+t` Tail current file.
- `ctrl+c` Exit the app.

### Opening Files

Open files from the command line.

```bash
$ tl foo.log bar.log
```

If you specify more than one file, they will be displayed within tabs.

#### Opening compressed files

If a file is compressed with BZip or GZip, it will be uncompressed automatically:

```bash
$ tl foo.log.2.gz
```

#### Merging files

Multiple files will open in tabs. 
If you add the `--merge` switch, TooLong will merge all the log files based on their timestamps:

```bash
$ tl mysite.log* --merge
```

### Pointer mode

Pointer mode lets you navigate by line.
To enter pointer mode, press `enter` or click a line. 
When in pointer mode, the navigation keys will move this pointer rather than scroll the log file.

Press `enter` again or click the line a second time to expand the line in to a new panel.

Press `escape` to hide the line panel if it is visible, or to leave pointer mode if the line panel is not visible.
